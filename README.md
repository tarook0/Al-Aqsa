## RequirementsTo run this simulation project,
 you need to have the following software and libraries installed on your system:
 - C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)
 - Modern OpenGL (supporting OpenGl 3.3 )
 - SFML library
 - GLEW library
 - GLM library

 ## Installation1.
- Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
        ```1.git clone https://github.com/tarook0/Al-Aqsa.git```
        ```2. Navigate to the project directory:cd Al Aqsa.```
        ```3. Build the project using  build system (meson), ensuring that all required libraries are linked correctly.```
## UsageOnce the project is successfully built,
- follow these steps to run the simulation:
        ```1. Open a terminal or command prompt.```
        ```2. Navigate to the project directory:cd Al Aqsa```
        ```3. Execute the compiled binary file: ./mosque_simulation ```
        ```4. The simulation window should open, displaying the Al Aqsa Mosque environment.```
## ControlsThe simulation
 provides the following controls for navigating and interacting with the mosque:
 - Mouse Movement: Move the mouse to look around in different directions.
 - W/A/S/D: Move forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
 - J: Toggle lighting mode (day/night).
 - K: Toggle lighting mode (day).
 - L: Toggle lighting mode (Of).
 - CTRl : Move Downward.
 - Left_shift : Move Upward.
 - Esc: Exit the simulation.
